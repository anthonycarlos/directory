* When loading students, automatically create a user for parents.

* If a parent registered their e-mail and it was saved correctly,
  they can request a password reset and then login to their account.

* If a parent did not register an e-mail or there was a typo, they must
  request an account by identifying their child, homeroom teacher, grade
and address. Admins will match them to a student, update the parent
e-mail address, and send an e-mail to the parent to request a password
reset.

* Audit history?
